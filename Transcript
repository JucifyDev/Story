write page 1 of 30 of chapter 1 of 20 of a story based on this transcript but take away the minecraft aspect and make it seem real: 
in the biggest social experiments ever done in Minecraft I scattered 1 000
0:06
people across four massive Islands to simulate a realistic civilization the players were given no help or guidance
0:12
and just like in real life if you die you remain Dead Forever no now each
0:18
player has the freedom to do whatever they want to gather resources join a society become a dictator or if it comes
0:26
down to it go to war with so many people on each island
0:32
anything can happen but I can promise you one thing this event ended up having
0:37
the most entertaining story arc I've ever seen you do not want to miss this
0:43
so pick a nation to root for and enjoy the video I presents to you the 1 000
0:49
player civilization experiment

1:05
alright everyone ready to be teleported jump if you're ready
Day 1
1:12
okay here we go foreign
1:19
on day one all one thousand players were teleported to their Islands each its own
1:25
biome we had planes Desert Snow and jungle this is huge most players spent
1:33
the first day scouting their Island searching for a place to settle but almost immediately we started to see
1:38
people dying and oddly they were all coming from the snow Island it turned out people were freezing to death after
1:44
getting stuck in powdered snow which looks exactly like regular snow but sucks you in like quicksand this guy
1:51
trying to freeze oh no even worse for the poor people on the snow Island Trees were almost
1:57
nowhere to be seen the desert island also had very few trees which players needed if they wanted to get wood but
2:04
the places where players did find trees quickly became extremely valuable hot spots for groups to settle at and
2:10
colonize look at all these people coming together Community crafting they're making progress meanwhile the people on
2:15
the Jungle Island had essentially unlimited trees and I was already thinking about other things what did you
2:21
say your plan was I'm gonna take over the world this is my right hand man Darbo hello right hand man darling
2:31
while having a lot of trees did seem like an advantage at first many jungle people found the island to be difficult
2:37
to Traverse given the immense amount of trees and the Hostile Mobs that would spawn on the surface due to lack of
2:43
sunlight this fear of traveling also made it more difficult for Jungle people to talk with
2:49
each other since players could only read chat messages from people 100 blocks away from them or less although frankly
2:56
at least they didn't have to see what me and the admins were looking at lastly we get to the plains Island and
3:02
boy was it different from the others it truly was just the perfect eye
3:09
bond with green grass trees animals and no natural dangers Cosmic a little
3:15
animal family Farm not needing to worry about dying as much as everyone else the people on the
3:20
plains Island were among the first to start mining for resources like iron or diamonds they were also the first to
3:26
build up Villages and yes to create civilizations throughout the first day you could see two main groups starting
3:32
to come together one of them a democracy led by a player named Horus Crown our
3:38
aim is building the most beautiful and nicest City on the entire server and the second also a democracy led by a player
3:44
named sidefall I just want to make sure nobody dies it was actually kind of odd how similar these two civilizations were
3:50
they were both located on the southern Shore they both had Democratic elections and their leaders both wanted good for
3:56
their own people I just hope nothing happens to change that ish I'm gonna make an Among Us character never mind I
4:02
hope they die soon it was the end of day one players across all four Islands logged off and made plans for the
4:09
following day [Music]
Day 2
4:14
it was on day two when civilizations really began to thrive in the Southeast
4:20
corner of the desert what used to be an empty patch of grass was turning into the desert's largest Nation hello good
4:26
sir yo what's up ish the salt on his back you might recognize the player's storming hell for my first civilization
4:32
video where he led a nation called the sultanates while now the desert dictator is back with the sultanate 2.0 and this
4:39
time with a population of over 100 people I want to maintain order and
4:45
peace in the desert the rules as established by the sultan included where proper attire do not eat pork complete
4:52
your mandatory work and most importantly acknowledge the sultan as the Supreme and divinely chosen leader moving on
4:59
since it was still hard to get food in the dry climate the people of the sultanate focused on developing different types of food production like
5:06
fishing in the surrounding ocean on top of this a player named drip chicken made a chicken Market although when I checked
5:12
picked it out myself it turned out to be a very different type of Market welcome to Las Pollos Hermanos thank you would
5:18
you like uh some totally legal sugar anyway we finally go back to the snow
5:24
Island as I was flying around I found what I can only describe as a British shrimp is the cold climate really the
5:30
best place for a shrimp I mean it depends look at my little friend over here you know wait who's your friend
5:36
underneath yes he's funny he's literally [Music]
5:42
oh he's up here now no no my fish buddy please go back down despite the killer
5:49
powdered snow and the occasional polar bear the people on the snow Island were actually doing pretty well building
5:54
settlements together nobody was fighting because everyone had one common enemy the harsh climate that being said it
6:01
turned out that all of these snow settlements might be a bit more than just little communities on day two rumor
6:10
was getting out about a conspiracy that despite them all being spread out across the entire Island a lot of these snow
6:16
settlements were actually all being run by one single person whose goal was to
6:23
unify the entire Snow Island under one Mighty Empire this person's name was
6:30
alanulo and he was running this entire Empire recruitment operation from an
6:36
underground bunker where he thought felt he was safe for the time being essentially what he would do was hold
6:42
beatings with people who were already leaders of their own settlements and convinced them to merge their
6:48
civilizations with his Empire so they would be stronger together he would give these leaders orders to fulfill and in
6:55
exchange they would be guaranteed high-ranking positions in the Empire if
7:00
this Empire actually succeeds in uniting all 300 people on the snow Island it
7:07
would easily become the most powerful nation in the world in fact it would be
7:12
bigger than the sultanate and the two Plains democracies combined will this
7:18
ambitious plan actually succeed let's see what happens in the following days
7:23
[Music]
7:29
foreign
7:36
[Music]
Day 3
7:44
we've now covered the politics of every island except for the jungle so what's going on here well quite frankly I had
7:52
no freaking idea it was chaos there were about 30 different camps and tribes
7:57
spread out across the entire Island and a lot of the horned constant fights with each other
8:03
who are the what is going on there's a fight here here's a tribe that imprisoned one of their own members for
8:08
being quote too rich I say we tax him and then let him out of jails so overall there was chaos nobody
8:16
trusted one another and to add to this nobody wanted to travel too far into the jungle because they were scared of Road
8:22
tribes and especially hostile mobs in fact we actually had to remove Creepers
8:27
on day three because they were killing too many people whoever asked now there
8:34
were actually two tribes that were considered the most influential In the Jungle the first a river-based
8:40
settlement called the sea people whose leader was killed almost immediately by a random Rogue tribe the new leader
8:46
yeekspeak dedicated his rule to maintaining order but also to keeping his people happy by setting up events
8:52
like stand-up comedy nights I got a few jokes about unemployed people oh wait none of them work the second influential
8:59
tribe was located in the dead center of the Jungle and it was what appeared to be a faction revolving around the
9:05
worship of a player named Seth hello Mr Seth oh what's up oh this is just creepy
9:11
you're telling me this isn't a personality cult not I wouldn't say that it's a way of life all right it's a
9:17
religion lastly as I was flying around I happened to run into this guy again I'm gonna take over the world believe it or
9:23
not he had actually become the leader of a pretty impressive settlement granted there was a lot of internal drama in his
9:30
tribe can you see this uh like really cool type of thing that we're building in yeah it looks great yeah yeah that's right it's really cool yeah and do you
9:36
see how far I'm over there now come over here could you tell us what this is in short
9:43
two of lasik's tribe members built a librarian's tower and he thought it was ugly and wanted to burn it down now when
9:49
I talked to the Librarians they said wasik just doesn't like the library because he's illiterate as I said drama
9:55
now the jungle wasn't the only place having problems the plains Island was seeing both a
10:02
surge in development this whole place is awesome but also a rise in tension the
10:08
leader of one of the plane's democracy's Horace Crown had found out that the other planes Nation run by sidefall had
10:14
reached out to the snow Island looking for potential alliances Horus Crown did
10:20
not like that sidefall was reaching out to other Islands instead of reaching out to him so he quickly established his own
10:26
alliance with two other plane settlements both located on the east side of the island which would
10:32
essentially cut off sidefall's axis to most of planes if a war were to break out we think sideful is definitely up to
10:39
something and we're planning to stop him the people living on the plains Island who had otherwise taken their peaceful lives for granted were getting very
10:45
worried about a potential massive war that would devastate their homes here in
10:50
KFC we want families not war meanwhile on the desert island the Sultan's storming hell was not happy when he
10:57
discovered that a group of Mountaineers had made their home a on the mountains surrounding the sultanate so the two
11:03
groups had a meeting to discuss this dispute over land why does the sultanate have any more right to a plot of land simply might makes rights we're stronger
11:11
so if it comes down to it made the stronger group win people in the desert were starting to get worried about storming hell's tyrannical nature so
11:18
some of them moves to a quickly growing Democratic Nation on the other side of the island this was theria the name
11:25
derived from the Greek word for freedom I asked their elected president Sapps about the sultanate hopefully we can
11:31
establish some peaceful relations for now I mean we're in the middle of a desert by fight you know overall each
11:37
island had its own conflict between the deserts Sultan dominance the plains is
11:42
Alliance disaster the jungle's total chaos and the snow Empire's takeover at
11:47
least one of these conflicts was bound to erupt very soon
Day 4
11:53
and that conflict was planes at the beginning of day four a propagandist
11:59
told everyone that sidefall was about to attack the plane's Island
12:04
Horace Crown called a code red and everyone on planes was freaking out including these guys at the center of
12:10
the Plains Island who built a Tavern on a lake I spoke with the bartender welcome to the tavern I hope you can
12:16
enjoy a nice beer since it might be our last foreign
12:22
you're probably wondering what was sidefall actually doing well it turns
12:27
out sidefall was just as confused as everyone else since he had no plans to attack anyone the propagandist had lied
12:35
I have no clue what these guys are talking about I don't want to attack anyone I don't want a civil war you were framed I can't believe it so now both
12:42
sides were gearing up for a war over nothing but a miscommunication and all throughout sidefall was desperately
12:48
trying to reach out to the other planes leader saying that he didn't want war the other leaders doubted him but they
12:55
actually agreed to meet with him as long as they met on neutral ground
13:01
whoever told you guys I won't work is lying tell us the truth then while they talked Horus Crown secretly had
13:07
undercover spies search sidefall's entire Village but he wasn't aware sidefall had someone else place a bunch
13:14
of TNT under his village but before things went too far
13:21
folks we have a peace deal [Music]
13:27
s diverted after talking the leaders had
13:32
made a peace treaty I actually didn't get to see much of the meeting but here's essentially what happened
13:37
sidefall first apologized to the other planes leaders for not being open with them specifically about his relationship
13:43
with the snow Island he told them he had only reached out to snow in hopes to get on the good side of a player named a
13:49
freaking turkey who was apparently a loanulo's second in command the planes
13:54
leaders discussed their disagreements on Foreign Relations Horace Crown preferring keeping alliances within
13:59
planes and sidefall believing in making allies on other Islands but they were able to put their differences aside they
14:07
banished the propagandist from the plains Island and that's the end the four major plains Nations created a
14:14
Great Plains Alliance the plains Island went from being on the brink of War to
14:20
being the most United island of all they're on us
14:26
it wasn't just planes toward the end of the day all four Islands were prospering
14:32
from the people on snow collecting resources and building together to the people in the desert working on the
14:37
Sultan's build project which was to create a massive holy city even the jungle was at peace at the end of day
14:43
four since the remaining jungle people were just thankful that they were still alive soon though it was the next day
Day 5
14:48
but before we let people back onto the server the admins and I decided to add a little something
14:54
[Music] we added a fifth island in the center of
15:02
the world and we didn't tell the players that we did this we wanted to see who would discover the island how long it
15:08
would take to find and then what would happen next so we started up the server and the wait began
15:17
but meanwhile we have to talk about the snow Island hello turkey hello how's it going on day
15:26
five the player a freaking turkey finally gave me a full explanation of the mysterious snow Empire which I found
15:33
out was named the aculon empire still fearing for his safety the
15:39
Empire's founder olanulo gave orders entirely from his secret underground bunker while his second in command a
15:45
freaking turkey carried out his orders and led the people on the ground you guys have settlements across the
15:51
entire Island there is a lot I just know none of it was made by slaves the Empire
15:56
relied on strict order to maintain peace it's now 200 citizens were each assigned
16:02
a daily job like building mining or fighting and whenever they were online all citizens were required to be in two
16:08
Discord voice channels at once which I didn't even know was possible also the aculon Empire made it a point to
16:14
document everything including its list of members its hierarchies its physical landmarks but what I found most
16:21
impressive was the high level operation going on in this seemingly regular building this singular building is the
16:28
richest place in the entire server they called this the Quartermasters house and it was where the aculod Empire not only
16:34
collected and stored all its resources but also distributed items using a complex request system where for example
16:40
a citizen asked for iron ingots and then the Quartermasters decide exactly how much iron that citizen deserves based on
16:46
a detailed algorithm they developed has anyone tried breaking into this place uh not yet let's just say if you tried to
16:53
get in without permission you're not gonna get a very nice welcome and I kid you not just a few minutes later this
16:58
player excelius was caught trying to sneak his way in and he was sentenced sentenced to a public execution to be
17:04
held the next day things are kind of stricter out here huh as long as they don't take my script I'm a happy man oh
17:10
man look at him the snow Island continues to be hyper Vigilant about criminals but so were other nations like
17:17
the desert sultanate which made an inescapable prison is surrounded by love or wasik's nation in The Jungle which
17:23
made a giant sand trap oh this is evil just you wait until we have a nice
17:29
little deliberation with something yeah I'm gonna be put to death you know like even planes didn't feel exactly safe as
17:36
this self-described capitalist nation made a giant wall to protect its people we want to make sure that Communists
17:42
cannot take this away from us but as I was talking to these guys I got tipped off from someone in the desert that
17:47
something about to happen uh the sultanate Arby's on the move
17:55
the sultan had sent his Elite Squad on a secret nighttime Mission their goal to
18:00
find a group of people that had been rumored to want to assassinate the sultan they're at the north side of the
18:06
island now oh yeah okay okay let's go let's go
18:12
according to the sultan the people hiding in this little settlement were indeed the attempted assassins and now
18:18
the group had a decision to make oh we're gonna kill this guy can we kill this guy up until now there hadn't been any violence between desert Nations will
18:26
this be the breaking point foreign
18:31
[Music]
18:39
's Elite Squad spent the rest of the night raiding the settlements but during their Chase of another suspected
18:44
assassin they ran literally into a major dilemma well you know he is running to Syria the guy they were trying to kill
18:51
was running toward the Democratic nation of theria to get Asylum there the sultanate is really about to roll up on
18:57
Theory holy it's because of major conflict but the souls in its Army didn't care they barged into theria and
19:04
searched every single house to find this one person who ultimately ended up getting away meanwhile the people of
19:11
Syria were freaked out by the raid but when they looked to their leader saps for guidance he was nowhere to be seen
19:18
he had fled eventually the sultanate's Army left but theria was not going to forget this
Day 6
19:30
laughs
19:35
[Music]
19:43
by attempting to blow up the quartermaster's house zealous betrayed our people and for this he must die
19:51
glory to Acura
19:58
it was a busy day for a freaking turkey the execution was successful but the
20:05
Empire didn't yet have a written Constitution or a justice system so a freaking turkey met with a player who
20:12
claimed to be a lawyer to set up a legal system you get the smaller seat unfortunately but do know it is quite
20:18
important as well I'm used to cramming into tight spaces afterward a freaking turkey took his guard to Drew and
20:24
confronted some farmers who he claimed weren't producing enough food for the Empire I swear I will not miss any
20:31
payment I have to owe you the bow please I expect five stacks of bread delivered
20:38
within one to two business days even though he was away so little at times a
20:48
day because he got things done and he was a charismatic speaker
20:53
fellow citizens it is my distinct honor to pronounce Steve and pixel as husband
20:59
and wife [Applause] even though he was only the second in
21:04
command of the snow's acculate Empire many people were starting to view a freaking turkey as a better candidate
21:10
for leader than ilanulo since most people in the Empire had never even seen a lonilo given that he's been hiding
21:16
underground the entire time afraid of being assassinated in fact some of his own citizens weren't even sure he
21:23
existed while ilanulo ruled from afar only talking with high-ranking officials a freaking turkey was considered a man
21:30
of the people someone who talks to everyone in fact a freaking turkey had gained so much notoriety that leaders of
21:37
other nations were starting to reach out to him for alliances rather than to alanulo so as a result of all of this
21:44
olanulo was starting to get a little worried turkey knows that I created this Empire
21:51
and its entire political system and as long as I am alive I will be its only
21:57
ruler foreign [Music]
22:14
here on the Jungle Island things haven't slowed down one bit amidst the chaos
22:20
this small group had made a monkey religion and their goal was to build the
22:25
biggest tree in the entire world while everyone else is fighting and
22:32
killing each other we are peacefully building by now every tribe in the jungle seems to have its own goal these
22:38
guys building a tree this group called The Blue Cross provided food and shelter to refugees meanwhile wasek's goal which
22:45
was still to take over the world was seemingly driving him mad especially after the Librarians built a second
22:52
tower you did this out of spice didn't you uh well no well yeah overall it
22:58
seemed like there was a lot on wazek's mind as if he was planning something something big
23:06
meanwhile Seth and the Sea people were still the two biggest tribes in the
23:11
jungle and both pursued very Innovative political strategies for example Seth
23:16
got married but only so he could parade around the jungle and demand wedding gifts from everyone and you know what it
23:23
freaking worked the sea people on the other hand had taken on a massive goal which was to finally end the chaos in
23:31
the jungle and they did this by sending out stealth groups and hunting down thieves and murderers and anyone who
23:37
they claimed did wrong however some of the supposed wrongdoers they killed were
23:43
actually allies of Seth in response Seth demanded that the sea people stop their
23:49
initiative immediately but the sea people plans to continue all of a sudden
23:55
the jungle island was on the verge of a massive war as if there wasn't enough
24:01
chaos already [Music] laughs
Day 7
24:07
[Music] wait is someone actually here I think so
24:16
whoa this is crazy this is awesome
24:22
in the middle on day seven a player named the Poke monkey discovered the secret fifth
24:29
Island the island had a mysterious dead terrain a small pre-built Village in the center and underground it contained
24:36
netherrite which is the strongest and rarest resource in the world
24:43
now poke monkey was a part of sidefall's nation in planes and he quickly alerted
24:49
sidefall about the very strange and unexpected Discovery he just made he's
24:54
Blue Lantern so people believe him guys I'm not lying there really is an island two minutes later another person found
25:02
the center Island the time someone from the jungle then like a domino effect more and more
25:08
people started arriving typically either alone or in small groups like these guys from the desert even though they all
25:14
came from different islands and Nations nobody was fighting in fact they seemed to be forming friendships and simply
25:21
admiring this new mysterious place he's saying this is amazing quickly word
25:26
began spreading across the world that there was a fifth Island and about 30 minutes into day seven basically
25:33
everyone knew it was crazy how fast everyone found out now some nations were
25:38
hesitant about visiting believing that the island was some sort of trap while other nations like the aculod Empire
25:44
sent out large exploratory groups to investigate the island so acculate is
25:50
here but instead of mining for another ride they're taking the wolf oh they don't have sheep in the snow
25:57
aisle that makes sense something I found interesting was that no Nation not even the snow Empire had
26:03
the courage to publicly claim the center Island as part of their Nation as their
26:08
territory probably because it would result in conflict with other nations which was my secret intention when
26:14
adding the island that it would cause some type of War but it didn't cause a war or maybe just not yet
26:22
[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause]
26:36
wow you've really expanded your business yeah we're doing quite well because starvation was such a big problem in the
26:43
desert drip chicken had made it his life's mission to feed the people of the desert and ever since I spoke with him
26:50
on day two next to his little food stand Los Pollos Hermanos had become a staple
26:55
of the sultanate but this business would soon run into some problems
27:01
see on days four and five the sultan storming hell was unsatisfied with the
27:06
slow progress on his build projects the holy city so he demanded that the farmers of the sultanate stopped growing
27:13
food and instead work on his build project and just like that the food
27:18
supply going into Los Pollos Hermanos had completely stopped the restaurant
27:24
suddenly had no food available to sell having no food drip chicken was instead
27:31
forced to sell some questionable products and he was caught selling these products by either the sultan or the
27:38
Sultan's twin guards he would probably receive a life sentence in the sultanate prison meanwhile the farmers of the
27:45
sultanate were unhappy since they wanted to farm not be forced to build so in a
27:51
rebellious move on day five drip chicken and the farmers secretly set up a
27:57
meeting with saps the leader of theria
28:03
I know you want to move to tharia but if you do the sultan will send his lead Squad to hunt you down so what do we do
28:10
foreign s or something there's about to be chaos in the desert and saps was correct there
28:17
was about to be chaos in the desert for reasons he couldn't tell the farmers just yet but he did tell me you know who
28:24
davard is yeah I think so he's one of the twin guards right he's about to leave the sultanate and join me really
28:30
the two people this the sultan trust the most are his two twin guards the bro
28:35
[Music] but one of them had grown tired of the authoritarian and warmongering ways of
28:42
the sultan so davoret had reached out to the leader of theria and together they
28:48
created the single craziest plan I have ever heard and this was it first David
28:55
leaves the sultanate to join theria next the sultan finds out about the Betrayal
29:01
and sends his Elite Squad to kill David then when the Elite Squad is away
29:06
hunting for David and the sultan is therefore alone dabarit will sneak back
29:11
into the sultanate and kill the sultan David will then claim leadership over
29:17
the sultanates and as the new leader he will finally bring peace to the desert
29:23
Deborah there is no way this works I'm chest head trust me you'll work all
29:29
right so at the end of day seven the Everett snuck out of the sultanate and headed to theria to begin the operation
29:36
while drift chicken and the farmers fled to the plains Island on their way out
29:42
some of them took one final look back at their home at their restaurants knowing
29:47
that they would probably never see it again knowing that the story of Los
29:53
boyos Hermanos had come to an end
Day 8
30:07
on day eight there was a major event on the snow Island
30:14
for the first time ever Emperor ilanulo had come out from his underground bunker
30:20
he had summoned the entire Snow Island to the aculon castle so he could
30:25
publicly be crowned as the leader before the coronation all high-ranking
30:31
officials were required to provide a lanilo a gift I present to you a high quality pair of Premium brand sneakers
30:38
thank you Applewood I Baron Saul Goodman give you this present Lord olanulo my
30:46
presence is your present after the gifts olanulo asked his second
30:51
in command a freaking turkey to make a speech affirming olanulo's Undisputed
30:57
leadership my friends the aculon Empire is the strongest nation in the world not
31:04
because of one leader but because of all of us thank you turkey at the end of the
31:11
ceremony olanilo asked all of his citizens to follow him down the main path of the empire in a
31:18
symbolic move meant to showcase the unity of the snow Island [Music]
31:31
but this image of unity was only a mirage there was a lot of discontent
31:37
building within the empire for many reasons people didn't like that alanilo's Knights were constantly
31:43
bossing them around nor did the aculon builders like it when alanilo forced them to work on the aculon castle
31:49
instead of letting them finish their own projects there was this General sense that alanilo might be overreaching with
31:55
his power especially when he started spying on his own citizens to see who
32:01
was criticizing his leadership see olanilo believed that in order for his citizens to have a good life they have
32:08
to live in a strong nation and the only way to maintain a strong nation was through complete Unity under a powerful
32:16
and unchallenged leader this is why ilanulo was fearful about the discontent
32:21
within his Nation as well as the rising popularity of his second in command a
32:28
freaking turkey knowing that they were being spied on many of a freaking turkey supporters
32:35
were becoming scared living on the snow Island afraid that they would be executed for not supporting a lotilo's
32:42
leadership so with the help of a freaking turkey plus another high-ranking official its Ender some
32:49
aculon citizens organized secret evacuations out of the snow Island
32:55
through underground tunnels some of which led to Seth's nation in the jungle others going to side Falls nation in
33:02
Planes both Seth and sidefall were very open to accepting refugees especially
33:07
those who opposed alanilo someone who they believed to be a dangerous Tyrant
33:12
also they had just found out that alanial had actually sent Spies all across the world including into their
33:19
own Nations so they didn't like him very much we're not going back until there's some
33:25
form of democracy in snow I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon meanwhile in Plains Mr Turkey are you
33:32
starting a revolution no no no I do not want a revolution I just want to make sure Alania doesn't kill these people
33:37
when are you going back to the snow Island probably tomorrow because I'm gonna try and host a meeting with alanila I just think he's gone too far
33:43
so while a freaking turkey stayed on the plains Island for the rest of the day Seth and sidefall created the first ever
33:51
multi-island treaty this treaty not only established Seth and sidefall as allies
33:56
but it also declared their nation's Refugee States ones that are willing to
34:01
accept all people fleeing from dictatorial regimes regimes like the sultanates or the aquilon Empire as for
34:09
a freaking turkey's position in the aculon Empire he was still technically the second in command but it was only a
34:16
matter of time before ilanulo finds out about the missing citizens and then it's very likely that turkey will be stripped
34:23
of his position or be kicked out of the snow Island entirely and become a
34:28
refugee he himself
34:34
[Music]
34:39
yeah I don't know if wait is that a basketball court on day eight the center
34:45
Island was getting a lot of visits from Curious players and instead of fighting each other everyone was just kind of
34:50
hanging out and doing their own thing what is the don't question me
34:58
later that night some adventurers started terraforming the dead terrain making it green this actually looks not
35:05
bad these guys meanwhile made a secret underground church and they hosted many ceremonies and cultural events what type
35:13
of ritual is this now I actually attended two churches on day eight the second one inside Falls Nation although
35:20
I was very disturbed by the person sitting next to me a near-death experience life began to feel more
35:27
sacred only two imparts I cannot say what they are however
35:35
right away to leave this world whoa what
35:42
did I do you're taking him away oh no later that night the plains Island
35:47
received an unexpected visit from the aculon Empire's state-sponsored journalist I'm with the news down with
35:55
the new go away tabloids go away no fast news today they're kicking out the journal so meanwhile I ran into these
36:03
planes farmers who literally did nothing but plants wheat everywhere oh my God
36:09
look at all this freaking weight now right next to the wheat field was a cookie factory in Horace crowns nation
36:15
which took the wheat and made a variety of baked goods see ever since the Great Plains Alliance was signed on day four
36:22
the people of plains believed their Island to be for the most part a very safe place to live and as a result many
36:29
players felt secure enough to run their own businesses there was the bakery and Outback Steakhouse boating and kayaking
36:36
two KFCs and there was the most recent edition Los Pollos Hermanos
36:43
you made one in the planes biome yes expansion claiming Refugee status drip
36:49
chicken in the sultanate farmers received citizenship inside Falls Nation where they were able to rebuild their
36:55
famous restaurants and the people of plains welcomed the refugees with open arms the only person who wasn't happy
37:01
was the owner of KFC who now had competition anyway when work got out in
37:07
the desert that drip chicken and the farmers had fled the salt in it as the diveritz many loyalists in the sultanate
37:12
were furious with these betrayals while the souls in it was still the second most powerful nation in the world the
37:18
first being aculon these Trails of the sultanate hurt the Sultan's Public Image
37:24
and he feared being seen as Weak by the world and by his own people so
37:30
predictably the sultan sent his Elite Squad out into the desert to try to find and kill both David and drip chicken but
37:39
instead of staying home in the sultanate this time the sultan traveled with his Elite Squad this threw a wrench into
37:46
davraut's assassination plan and David had no choice but to keep hiding underground until he saw an opportunity
37:53
to strike meanwhile the leader of theria saps was extremely worried because he
37:59
knew that the fate of his nation and his people rested on this assassination attempt if it succeeds and the sultan is
38:06
killed well then all is well but if it fails it will only be a matter of time
38:12
before The Sultans finds out that saps was behind the plan and then there is no doubt that the sultan will seek revenge
38:18
and absolutely oblit iterate theria killing not just saps but all his people
38:24
who by the way were entirely innocent staffs purposefully didn't tell any of
38:29
his citizens that he was involved in an assassination plot because they definitely wouldn't approve of something
38:35
that puts them in such danger all of this tension in the desert was really starting to get to some people like this
38:41
group which made a giant lava wall around their civilization they wanted
38:46
nothing to do with the politics of the desert and they were rather paranoid about everything the walls keep us safe
38:53
we can't leave the walls for long he said we're not safe everyone inside the walls of State everyone outside is not
38:59
safe they're strangers we shouldn't trust them oh by the way also don't push any buttons you find in here okay I actually
39:06
think this group was more of a cult than a civilization but still I think they had the right idea
39:13
and now we go back to the jungle war I say War because both major Nations had
39:21
already basically decided that they cannot coexist in the jungle Seth was mad at the sea people for killing many
39:27
of his allies while the sea people were mad because Seth wouldn't let them kill those who they believed to be criminals
39:32
neither nation was willing to compromise on this so War seemed inevitable
39:38
however because Seth had also recently formed an alliance with sidefall from Planes a war between the two jungle
39:45
nations would likely cause sidefall as well as the rest of the Plains Island to join the battle thus turning this into
39:51
an actual World War so given that the stakes were so much higher now both
39:57
sides agreed to have one final meeting to maybe work things out it was wazuk
40:02
who quickly offered his Nation as a good neutral location for the meeting and he was quite enthusiastic about hosting
40:10
on day eight Seth and the Sea people sensed their highest ranking officials to wazek's Nation where the meeting
40:16
would take place [Music] all right Seth you're up first
40:25
I think um the sea people are killing people for a lot of irrational reasons so you know as an example right they had
40:31
a five stacks of cookies taken from them that takes like three minutes to get bro and he's like I don't think you should murder someone over there we requested
40:37
he'd give it back and he basically said no so he was put on Kos and we killed him so that was exactly what Seth just
40:42
said I mean let me add some contacts soon the argument began to escalate and
40:48
the people you attacked were direct allies I'm sorry but what other ways do we have to stop the chaos in the jungle
40:54
they stole they deserve to be killed over it do you really want to go to war over this well if you keep killing our people then we want to stand by and
41:00
watch all right fine to see people declare war all right let's do it but before a fight could begin wasek yelled
41:06
double now
41:19
oh my God
41:29
Watson had just killed seven people using his sand trap before getting away Seth and the Sea people decided to put
41:36
their war on hold and declared a unified worldwide Manhunt for wazuk everyone was
41:42
confused about why wazza did this but then I remembered something watik had told me the day before listen if the war
41:49
breaks out I have a plan to stop it really how oh you'll see my friend when
41:54
Seth and the Sea people declared war on each other wasik decided to use his sand trap and make himself the villain so
42:02
that the entire jungle would make peace to unite against him therefore actually
42:07
preventing a World War wasik is now hiding Underground
42:15
[Music]
Day 9
42:25
after spending most of the previous day trying to hunt down his enemies the sultan storming hell decided to take a
42:31
break from the hunt and attend a wedding hosted by a small neighboring desert Nation it was a huge honor in the desert
42:38
for the sultan to visit your civilization so there was a lot of Buzz surrounding the Sultan's visit and
42:43
everyone in the desert knew he would be there the twin guard was also at the wedding
42:49
and he was quite thankful for the break since he secretly despised having to hunt for his own brother when the sultan
42:56
demanded the dafford be tracked down and killed zomta was horrified by this order but he kept silence fearing that he'd be
43:04
next zonta could only hope that davurant was Far Away Now hiding in a place where
43:09
the sultan would never find him but it turned out daver it was not far away at all because he was on a mission
43:20
he's actually here
43:29
davoren was coming to kill the sultan but he had to be sneaky because the sultan was guarded by his elite team the
43:36
plan was to catch him and his team off guard since it would only take a few to kill him
44:10
oh David
44:15
holy crap oh he's hit him so many times
44:22
wait sorry is getting away the elite team is on Davern big time
44:28
[Music]
44:35
oh oh he's getting close he's getting close oh he turned around
44:41
holy crap everyone's here this is insane
45:25
[Music]
45:33
salt is on his way back home I think what is happening
45:43
[Music]
45:56
what
46:04
oh boy angry about the death of his brother David zomped to betrayed and killed the
46:11
sultan storming hell in what he called an act of Revenge all of a sudden within
46:17
the span of a few minutes storming hell saps and davoret were all dead both the
46:23
sultanate and theria were without a leader and the desert island was in a state of total confusion
46:31
now because the sultanate didn't have a solid line of succession there was a short power struggle that ended with the
46:37
sultanate getting completely dissolved on day 9 the second most powerful nation
46:42
in the world had fallen and most of the sultanate citizens ended up fleeing that
46:48
being said it wasn't totally the end some who were still loyal to the late Sultan decided to form their own
46:54
militias whose only goal was to track down zamta and Avenge the sultan we are
47:01
called by our divine leader to kill the dirty traitor mashallah
47:08
theria on the other hand didn't dissolve and instead elected a new leader a player named Joe feel who was well liked
47:16
and trusted in the community still the people of theria would continue to live in a state of fear afraid they would be
47:22
invaded by one of the new desert militias also they would never find out why their founder saps jumped off the
47:29
Therian Tower which he did because of guilt after he saw Deborah die saps
47:34
believed that the sultan would invade and Destroy theria and he felt too ashamed knowing that he would be
47:40
responsible it was only thanks to zomta that The Invasion didn't happen
47:46
the death of the sultan sent shock waves throughout not just the desert but the whole world many nations went on
47:53
lockdown including the aculon Empire while they technically weren't allies Emperor olanulo had always admired
48:01
Sultan storming how strong authoritarian leadership so after the lockdown alanilo
48:06
sent his diplomats to the desert to offer support to the sultanate militias
48:12
at the same time on the plains Island drip chicken of Los Pollos Hermanos was
48:18
watching the desert from afar and he was worried about these rumored desert militias because drip chicken was from
48:24
the desert he was able to educate his customers and planes about the politics of the desert and after sapsa's death he
48:32
encouraged sidefall to send diplomats to theria quickly and sidefall did just
48:37
that on day 9 theria officially joined Seth and all the planes nations in the
48:42
refugee State contract and what originally started as a simple Refugee agreement between Seth and sidefall had
48:49
now turned into a worldwide alliance called The Alliance of democratic
48:56
nations or put simply the allies
49:04
[Music] foreign [Music]
49:16
Empire continued their daily routines the highest ranking officials of the
49:21
Empire gathered to discuss the new existential dilemma they were now facing the aculon Empire had always been the
49:29
most powerful nation in the world and it's still technically is but when adding together the populations of all
49:36
the states in the democratic nations Alliance it is the Allies that have more people overall this made aculon
49:43
officials extremely worried they saw this as the first legitimate threat to
49:48
the regime alanilo agreed with this view but at the moment his attention was on another
49:55
problem entirely the problem known as a freaking turkey
50:01
a freaking turkey's rise to popularity had always bothered alanilu but now this
50:07
conflict was at an absolute breaking point because yesterday one of ilanulu's spies caught a freaking turkey helping
50:14
snow citizens flee the Empire fleeing or defecting was strictly against aculon
50:20
law olani love spy also saw a freaking turkey hanging out with not just
50:25
sidefall but nearly all the major planes leaders which made a lotilo think is a
50:32
freaking turkey planning something is he secretly working with the Allies is he
50:37
about to orchestrate a full-scale revolution or an invasion of the aculon Empire these were all questions that
50:45
aladila was wrestling with and the more he thought about it the more he convinced himself that a freaking turkey
50:51
was probably committing some sort of treason and needed to be stopped
50:56
yesterday a freaking turkey had reached out to olanulo for a meeting and today aladilo accepted this request but with
51:04
the fear conditions one this meeting takes place at the akulon castle two turkey comes alone and three the meeting
51:11
takes place not today but tomorrow because alaniola needed some extra time for his Builders to finish a certain
51:18
project located on the top of the aculon castle nobody knew why or what the
51:23
strange looking Tower was but ilanulo insisted it be completed by the time
51:29
turkey shows up foreign
51:34
ly going to be interesting so make sure everyone's ready lastly later in the day
51:40
olodilo sent diplomats to establish alliances with both the desert militias and with the sea people in the jungle
51:47
alanilo appreciated the sea people's value of order and he promised that he
51:52
will help him stop the chaos in the jungle and help them catch their number one most wanted criminal wazuk the sea
51:59
people accepted this Alliance but they ended up not needing accuwon's help because later to day 9 wasic decided to
52:07
turn himself in [Music] about to be executed a guilty conscience
52:13
perhaps [Music]
52:28
all right wazek I uh understand you have a prepared statement you may now read
52:34
your final words yes thank you hello everyone it's your old friend
52:39
wasok in the beginning I wanted to rule the world but I've made some bad decisions and now
52:47
it's my time to go you killed innocence
52:52
if there's one thing I've learned is that time can never be your trusted
52:58
friend
53:03
long live the jungle [Music]
53:10
oh shoot [Music]
53:29
after deciding that being a criminal in hiding isn't how he wanted to live wasik
53:35
instead chose to face his inevitable death on his own terms and by doing so he gave the jungle one last moment of
53:43
unity the conflict between the two major jungle tribes was still unresolved
53:49
especially now that they were in opposing alliances but for this brief moment there was peace in the jungle
53:57
well that was fun everyone's coming down the tree now most Nations around the world took the
54:04
end of day 9 to rest and reflect on how far they've come for example the jungle's Blue Cross Ride celebrated
54:11
becoming International with at least one charity location on each island
54:16
meanwhile in the desert the two sultanate militias held a funeral for the late Sultan where they vowed to get
54:23
revenge and chanted death to theria after which they proceeded to finish building the Sultan's holy city in his
54:31
honor theria on the other hand expanded its reach into the Arts and became the first civilization to develop music
54:41
oh lastly on the plains Island businesses
54:46
were booming and civilizations were thriving on day 9 the plains Island had finished the construction of the ish the
54:54
international State Highway which made trade and transportation between the major plains Nations much faster overall
55:02
the building and architecture and player creativity in Planes was simply amazing
55:08
and it was all made possible by the political stability of the Plains Island
55:15
many in the desert and jungle and snow looked at planes as The Shining Beacon
55:21
that they can aspire to be like one day
55:32
[Music] as the end of the day approached a freak
55:38
and turkey returned to the plains Tavern after spending the day traveling around the world visiting civilizations In the
55:46
Jungle the deserts and of course the plains Island during many of his visits he was very
55:52
surprised when he found out that most people from these foreign Nations not only knew about him but admired him this
55:59
was because rumor had spread about his Disobedience to ilanulu and as a result he had earned a worldwide reputation as
56:07
the savior of refugees The Honorable Rebel the man who stood up to the
56:12
emperor and everywhere a freaking turkey went he was welcomed with open arms by
56:18
the way I think it would have been perfect for that yeah I heard there was a comedy show here you should have called me over when it came to the
56:24
aculod Empire the truth was a freaking turkey had no intention of causing any
56:30
type of Uprising or revolution in fact he was strictly against the idea knowing
56:36
just how devastating a major war would be but he did want change in the Empire
56:43
during his prolonged stay in Planes he had seen what freedom and democracy
56:49
looked like he had come to regret his more tyrannical actions in the early days and he now envisioned a reformed
56:56
akulan Empire his new dream was to bring democracy to snow bring freedom to the
57:03
people of the accuwon Empire and make the snow refugees feel safe to come back
57:09
home I might just be overly optimistic but I
57:15
think we can achieve world peace okay if a freaking turkey is able to convince alanilo to convert the Empire from a
57:23
tyrannical dictatorship into a free democracy and then the aculot Empire
57:28
ends up joining the Allies then World Peace wouldn't just be a far-fetched
57:33
idea for Wishful thinkers it would actually happen with this massive goal in mind a
57:41
freaking turkey prepared for tomorrow for his big meeting with alanilo
Day 10
57:55
remember everything we talked about we'll be watching before a freaking turkey took off for the snow Island he
58:02
had met with the four major planes leaders one last time to tell them what he hopes to achieve in his upcoming talk
58:09
with ilanulo
58:14
planes leaders were pessimistic see when they heard about alanilo's strict
58:19
conditions for the meeting to take place they suspected that this was going to be the meeting where olanito removes turkey
58:26
from his second in command position or Worse pots turkey in aculon's prison
58:33
foreign s today the plane's leaders promised
58:38
turkey that he has the full support of the Allied Nations even if they can't
58:44
attend the meeting they will be watching and will do whatever they can to help
58:49
him
58:56
there we go turkey is now back on the snow Island I think he's going to the meeting right
59:02
away [Music]
59:15
thank you
59:21

1:01:03

1:01:10
take this throne for yourself what there's nothing you can do at this point to convince me that you're not
1:01:16
plotting a revolution against me I thought you read it no Elon yellow yes

1:01:35

1:01:41
because they thought you were going to kill them and to be honest so did I
1:01:46
[Music] so that's the point of this meeting you want to get rid of me
1:01:54

1:01:59
I'm just gonna go okay [Music]

1:02:45
oh wait they're killing turkey supporters
1:02:51
they're hunting down his supporters as well this is crazy
1:02:57
like that there was a Purge on the snow Island and many of turkey's supporters
1:03:03
were killed the few who were able to escape immediately swam to the other
1:03:09
Islands to tell everyone exactly what happened and all of the
1:03:15
night started executing Bernie Ender turkey they assassinated some of the
1:03:22
most loved members of echelon when a freaking turkey's death message appeared in chess people around the world were
1:03:28
outraged and shortly after the leaders of the Allied Nation started activating their militaries putting them on standby
1:03:36
turkey once visited Los Pollos Hermanos I'm giving the Army chicken for 50 off
1:03:41
to make sure they're ready for battle meanwhile Eladio got word that the
1:03:47
Allies were preparing their armies so he declared a full lockdown reached out to his own allies and called them to the
1:03:53
aculon castle to be ready in case the Allies declare war and sure enough when
1:03:59
the police leaders talked with theria and Seth the votes was unanimous on day
1:04:04
10 the alliance of democratic nations officially declared war on the aculon
1:04:12
empire that's why I say I wish you luck and great success hopefully we all see some
1:04:19
to sign the Constitution of the new aculon Republic the new acting on Republic that we all dream about having
1:04:24
thank you thank you all this isn't about us this isn't about our lives it's about
1:04:32
the turkey and preventing the world of tyranny all the Allied Nations met up at
1:04:37
the center Island so they could attack the snow Island together
1:04:44
today we fight for Revenge we fight for
1:04:49
freedom
1:04:59
come on
1:05:12
but little did the Allies know Eladio had set a trap the aculon builders had
1:05:19
taken inspiration from history and created what they called the iron torch
1:05:24
the most advanced defensive tower in the world complete with dangerous height
1:05:30
sturdy walls Arrow slits and lava cover [Music]

1:08:01
[Applause]
1:08:41
[Applause]
1:08:48
[Music] thank you wait how long you died
1:08:56
[Music] yes
1:09:04
soon after olanulo died the aculon Empire officially surrendered
1:09:11
you should say they surrendered kill still kill them but even though aculon surrendered the Allies didn't stop
1:09:18
fighting no mercy no mercy I'll say no mercy [Applause]
1:09:24
like that there was a Purge on the snow Island but this time it was the
1:09:30
supporters of turkey doing the killing it's just an absolute Slaughter Fest
1:09:42
after a while the Allies had completely taken over the iron torch and all the
1:09:48
aculod forces had either been killed or had fled the island and gone into hiding
1:09:54
and with that the alliance of democratic nations had defeated the aculon empire
1:10:02
[Music] or ended and the clouds parted that the
1:10:10
Allies were finally able to reflect on what they had done
1:10:16
they had succeeded but they had also shown no mercy
1:10:22
when their enemy surrendered they continued to be ruthless and thirsty for
1:10:27
blood it was as if they had become their enemy
1:10:35
as the Allies each safely returned to their homes now with a clear mind many
1:10:41
of them felt regret neither side was completely innocent and
1:10:47
the war was complicated but at least it was over
1:10:54
and the Allies had won [Music]
Epilogue
1:11:05
over the next few days the people of plains Feria Seth and a few smaller
1:11:11
Nations created a world alliance with a massive Parliament building on the
1:11:18
center Island where world leaders met to discuss the Affairs of their Nations and
1:11:24
most importantly to keep the peace and the first order of business was
1:11:29
pardoning the few living players who fought for aculon so they didn't have to
1:11:35
live in hiding [Music] meanwhile the snow refugees were able to
1:11:42
move back to the snow Island and create the new aculon Republic putting
1:11:48
democracy in snow they also tore down the remains of the iron torch and put in
1:11:55
its place a graveyard honoring all who died in the Battle of acuan and
1:12:02
overlooking the graveyard was the man or turkey who inspired them all
1:12:09
[Music]
1:12:16
and so the jungle went back to hosting comedy shows the desert went back to
1:12:22
pursuing the Arts and drift chicken went back to running [Music]
1:12:28
after all that happened throughout the days things were finally settling down
1:12:35
[Music]
1:12:43
for many players the new found piece allowed for new stories to begin but for
1:12:50
us it's a good place to end
1:13:01
[Music]
